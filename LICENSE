 conditions below.

 1. Definitions

 "Licensor" means Hybrowse / Arens & Gerstner GbR.

 "Licensed Work" means the contents of this repository.

 "You" means the individual or legal entity exercising rights under this
 license.

 "Affiliate" means any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under
 common control with an entity. "Control" means direct or indirect control of
 more than 50% of the voting interests or the power to direct management.

 "Third Party" means any person or entity other than You and Your Affiliates.

 "Internal Use" means use of the Licensed Work by You, Your Affiliates, and
 Third Parties acting solely on Your behalf (for example, contractors and cloud
 infrastructure providers).

 "Redistribute" means to provide or make available the Licensed Work (or any
 derivative works) to any Third Party other than for Internal Use, including by
 publishing source code or distributing it outside of Internal Use.

 "Production Use" means use of the Licensed Work to provide gameplay or
 service functionality to end users (including running game servers that accept
 player connections), other than solely for evaluation, testing, or
 development.

 "Network" means a single player-facing Hytale server offering operated under
 the same brand, domain(s), and/or shared progression/economy, where players can
 reasonably be considered part of one combined service (including multiple
 backend servers/shards/regions).

 "Peak CCU" means the maximum number of concurrently connected players across
 the entire Network in a rolling 30 day window.

 "Game Server" means a running Hytale dedicated server instance or backend
 shard that serves gameplay for the Network (including regional replicas).
 For avoidance of doubt, multiple containers/pods running a server instance
 count as multiple Game Servers.

 "Peak Game Server Count" means the maximum number of Game Servers
 simultaneously running for the Network in a rolling 30 day window.

 "Managed Service" means making the Licensed Work available to third parties
 as a hosted or managed offering (including server hosting, managed fleets,
 server rentals, multi-tenant platforms, or any service where third parties run
 or control servers backed by the Licensed Work).

 "Commercial Agreement" means a written agreement with Licensor granting
 commercial usage rights outside the free use grants in this license.

 "Permitted Free Use" means Production Use that satisfies all of:
 - You are not providing a Managed Service.
 - The use is for a self-operated network/community.
 - Peak CCU <= 250.
 - Peak Game Server Count <= 10.

 2. Grant of rights (source available)

 Subject to the restrictions below, Licensor grants You a worldwide,
 non-exclusive, non-transferable right to:

 - access and read the source code of the Licensed Work
 - copy the Licensed Work for Internal Use
 - modify the Licensed Work and create derivative works
 - run the Licensed Work for evaluation, testing, and development

 You may permit Internal Use by Your Affiliates and Third Parties acting solely
 on Your behalf.

 3. Production use

 You may use the Licensed Work in Production Use only if one of the following is
 true:

 - your use qualifies as Permitted Free Use, or
 - you have a Commercial Agreement with Licensor.

 3.1 Threshold exceedance transition period

 Notwithstanding Section 3, if your use stops qualifying as Permitted Free Use
 solely because you exceed Peak CCU and/or Peak Game Server Count, you may
 continue Production Use for up to 30 days solely to:

 - enter into a Commercial Agreement with Licensor, or
 - reduce usage so that it again qualifies as Permitted Free Use, or
 - cease using the Licensed Work in production.

 If you cure within this period, your rights under this license continue.

 This transition period does not apply to Managed Service usage.

 4. Managed Service prohibition

 You may not use the Licensed Work as part of a Managed Service unless you
 have a Commercial Agreement.

 This restriction applies regardless of Peak CCU, Peak Game Server Count, or
 whether the Managed Service is offered for free or for a fee.

 5. Redistribution

 For avoidance of doubt, Internal Use is not Redistribution.

 You may redistribute verbatim copies of the Licensed Work, and you may
 redistribute Your derivative works, only if:

 - the redistribution is in source form
 - you include this license text in full
 - you do not remove or alter copyright, trademark, or attribution notices
 - you clearly mark Your changes
 - the recipient’s use remains subject to this license

 You may not redistribute the Licensed Work in a way that enables or primarily
 facilitates Managed Service usage without a Commercial Agreement.

 6. Trademarks

 This license does not grant any rights to use Licensor’s trademarks.
 Trademark guidance is documented in `TRADEMARKS.md`.

 7. Termination

 Any use of the Licensed Work in violation of this license automatically
 terminates Your rights under this license.

 If you rely on the threshold exceedance transition period in Section 3.1 and
 you do not cure within the 30 day period, your rights under this license
 terminate automatically at the end of that period.

 8. Disclaimer of warranty

 THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS
 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

 9. Limitation of liability

 TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE
 LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED
 WORK.

 10. Enforcement

 Unauthorized Production Use or Managed Service usage without a Commercial
 Agreement is outside the scope of the rights granted by this license.
 Licensor reserves all rights and remedies available under applicable law,
 including injunctive relief.
