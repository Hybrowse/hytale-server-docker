# Commercial licensing (program summary)

This document describes Hybrowse / Arens & Gerstner GbR’s commercial licensing program for the Hybrowse Hytale stack.

**Important:** This file is a program summary. It does not modify the repository license.
For the repository license and version transition notes, see [`LICENSING.md`](LICENSING.md) and [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

## What is covered

Commercial licensing is intended for organizations that use one or more of these Hybrowse components at commercial scale:

- Hytale Server Docker Image
- Hytale Session Token Broker
- Hytale Player Connection Router (Hyrouter)

By default, commercial licensing is offered as an **all-in-one bundle** (one agreement) covering the stack.
If you only need a subset, Hybrowse may offer a narrower scope on request.

## When you likely need a commercial license

You likely need a commercial license if you:

- operate a **hosting / managed service** offering for third parties, or
- operate a **self-hosted network** outside the free-use thresholds in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) (for example: Peak CCU > 250 or Peak Game Server Count > 10)

## What commercial customers typically get

Commercial agreements can include:

- commercial usage rights (scope defined in the agreement)
- professional support (best-effort or SLA)
- onboarding and operational architecture review
- priority bug fixes
- roadmap coordination for provider/network needs

## Pricing

Pricing is provided **on request**.
Hybrowse will quote based on business model (provider vs self-operated network), scale band, deployment footprint, and support needs.

## How to request a quote

- **Discord intake:** https://hybrowse.gg/discord

Hybrowse will request a contact email and continue contracting/invoicing over email.

## Security and data handling

- Do not share tokens, credentials, or secrets in Discord.
- If technical verification is required for support, use redacted logs and file-based secret references.
